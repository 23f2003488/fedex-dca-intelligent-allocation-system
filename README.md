# FedEx DCA Intelligent Allocation System

## Problem Statement
Large enterprises like FedEx manage thousands of overdue accounts through multiple external Debt Collection Agencies (DCAs). These agencies differ in recovery effectiveness, specialization, and compliance behavior. Manual and uniform allocation of cases results in delayed recoveries, increased escalations, and limited governance visibility.

## Solution Overview
This project presents an AI-driven DCA management platform that prioritizes overdue cases and intelligently assigns them to the most suitable DCA. The system learns from historical outcomes, enforces SLA-driven workflows, and provides performance analytics to improve recovery efficiency and accountability.

## Key Capabilities
- Recovery probability prediction
- DCA capability and risk scoring
- Intelligent case-to-DCA matching
- SLA monitoring and escalation
- Performance dashboards

## Data Note
Due to confidentiality of enterprise debt data, publicly available credit risk and payment behavior datasets are used to demonstrate the AI models. The architecture is data-agnostic and designed for seamless integration with internal FedEx systems.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit
